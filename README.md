# GrantScout: AI-Powered Grant Discovery Platform

GrantScout is a visually stunning, minimalist web application designed to help users effortlessly discover and track funding opportunities. Built on Cloudflare's edge network, it offers a lightning-fast, intuitive interface for searching, filtering, and saving grants. The application features a clean, card-based layout for grant listings, a powerful search with multiple filter criteria (category, funding amount, deadline), and a client-side 'saved grants' functionality for easy tracking. The design prioritizes clarity, readability, and a delightful user experience with subtle micro-interactions and animations, making the often tedious process of finding grants simple and elegant.
